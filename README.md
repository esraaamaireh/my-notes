## Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset 

 ### To avoid these many issues, developers should embrace the fundamental laws of software and develop a mindset to make better decisions there are key points that every developer must master starting with
 -understand the purpose of the software ,  design software that will help users and  software will continue to help them for a long time, understand the work , Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming A good developer is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers  the main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it
- Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.
- The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
- To solving problems you have to understanding then planning and The third step is dividing don’t try to solve one big problem.
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
- Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future
- Don’t reinvent the wheel
- As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.
- If you can automate it, automate it
- The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
- Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible
- Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.
- Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. 
- Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.
- The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing. If you don’t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it.
- Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
- Keep learning , open-minded
- Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help ,Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help .
